# Story2Hallucination

This is a Colab notebook used to render paragraphs and whole stories of text as animations using [Big Sleep](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep/).  The animations from the stories look wild, hence, Story2Hallucination.

The [main notebook](https://github.com/lots-of-things/Story2Hallucination/blob/main/Story2Hallucination.ipynb) runs on Colab and generates raw images and saves them to drive so you can download and create longer videos.  There is also a [GIF making notebook](https://github.com/lots-of-things/Story2Hallucination/blob/main/Story2Hallucination_GIF.ipynb) that will make a GIF on colab that you can display or download directly without connecting to Drive (but note that large gifs won't play on colab and will take a long time to download).

For more info please see the [Big Sleep repo](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep/) and [this blog post](https://bonkerfield.org/2021/01/story2hallucination/).
